# hjemVectorI
## General goal
Make a compass that guides you along a given route. The goal is to implement this with an arduino Uno, compass and gps sensor. For user interface there will be a round lcd or oled. Other fetures that are planned are haptic feedback, spirit level/tilt and diffrent fetures that use the diffrent senors. The plan is to use a relativly old arduino uno, so it will also be an exserice in memory optimalzation
## Task list and progress. Subject to change
☑️Haptic feedback tests <br>
❎Implementing GPS sensor<br>
❎Implementing compass sensor<br>
❎Implementing spiritlevel/tilt sensor<br>
❎Implementing screen<br>
❎Memory optimalzation (if and when needed)<br>
